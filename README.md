ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yeungjason12, an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside studying Computer Science with Business Applications.
I do not have a specialization currently, though Iâ€™m interested in network security, AI, web development... anything that is new and challenging.

I have experience C++ , Python, x86 Assembly, data analysis, data structures, and design patterns, albiet basic through intermediate level knowledge.

Here you can find projects I've collaborated on throughout college.

You can reach me at yeungjason12@gmail.com.
